# Probabilities-in-the-Bayesian
Bayesian probability belongs to the category of evidential probabilities; to evaluate the probability of a hypothesis, the Bayesian probabilist specifies a prior probability. This, in turn, is then updated to a posterior probability in the light of new, relevant data (evidence). The Bayesian interpretation provides a standard set of procedures and formulae to perform this calculation.

**Bayes’ Theorem overview**

'A' is the event of interest. As a starting point, P(A) represents our prior belief: probability of event A occurring. With new evidence B, the posterior belief or updated probability is represented P(A|B): probability of event A given evidence B has occurred.

Bayes’ Theorem has two types of probabilities :

1.Prior Probability [P(H)]

2.Posterior Probability [P(H/X)]

where, 

X – X is a data tuple.

H – H is some Hypothesis.

1. Prior Probability:  Prior Probability is the probability of occurring an event before the collection of new data. It is the best logical evaluation of the probability of an outcome which is based on the present knowledge of the event before the inspection is performed.

2. Posterior Probability:  When new data or information is collected then the Prior Probability of an event will be revised to produce a more accurate measure of a possible outcome. This revised probability becomes the Posterior Probability and is calculated using Bayes’ theorem. So, the Posterior Probability is the probability of an event X occurring given that event H has occurred.
