# Probabilities-in-the-Bayesian
Bayesian probability belongs to the category of evidential probabilities; to evaluate the probability of a hypothesis, the Bayesian probabilist specifies a prior probability. This, in turn, is then updated to a posterior probability in the light of new, relevant data (evidence). The Bayesian interpretation provides a standard set of procedures and formulae to perform this calculation.

**Bayesâ€™ Theorem overview**

'A' is the event of interest. As a starting point, P(A) represents our prior belief: probability of event A occurring. With new evidence B, the posterior belief or updated probability is represented P(A|B): probability of event A given evidence B has occurred.
